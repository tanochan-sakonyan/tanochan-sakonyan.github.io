    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to the Shukinkun app (hereinafter the “App”)
      provided by Yuma Ikeo (hereinafter the “Service Provider”). The App is
      offered free of charge. Future updates may introduce certain paid
      features.
    </p>

    <h2>【Information Collection and Use】</h2>
    <p>
      The App collects information when you download and use it. This
      information may include the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g., IP address)</li>
      <li>
        The pages you visit within the App, the date and time of each visit, and
        the duration spent on each page
      </li>
      <li>The duration of your use of the App.</li>
      <li>The operating system of the mobile device you are using.</li>
      <li>Your LINE user ID</li>
      <li>Your LINE username</li>
      <li>
        Other information collected via LINE Login and group information
        retrieval using LINE.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The App does not collect precise location information from your mobile
      device.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Service Provider may use the information you provide to contact you
      from time to time in order to deliver important updates, necessary
      notifications, and marketing promotions.
    </p>

    <p>
      To provide you with a better experience, while using the Shukinkun app,
      the Service Provider may ask you to supply certain personal information.
      This may include your LINE user ID, LINE username, and other data
      collected via LINE Login. Any information requested by the Service
      Provider will be retained by them and used in accordance with this Privacy
      Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>【Information Management】</h2>

    <h3>Uninstalling the App</h3>
    <p>
      If you uninstall the Shukinkun app from your device, the Service Provider
      will cease collecting any new personal information via your mobile device.
      Any data related to Shukinkun remaining on your device (for example, event
      or member information) may also be deleted.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, any personal information collected by the Service Provider prior
      to uninstallation may continue to be processed in the Service Provider’s
      systems. In such cases, you will be treated as a “new user” by Shukinkun
      and the Service Provider’s advertising partners, unconnected to any of
      your past usage history or data.
    </p>

    <h3>Account Deletion</h3>
    <p>
      To permanently delete your account, open the app’s Settings screen and
      select “Delete Account.” This will unlink your LINE or Apple account from
      Shukinkun and remove your account from your mobile device. Please note
      that once you delete your account, all event, member, payment amount, and
      payment status information stored in the app will be lost and may not be
      recoverable. The Service Provider may continue processing any personal
      information collected prior to your account deletion.
    </p>

    <h2>【Third-Party Access】</h2>
    <p>
      Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external
      services to help the Service Provider improve the App and Service. The
      Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the
      manner described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Service Provider may disclose information you provide or that is
      automatically collected in the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal
        process.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the Service Provider has a good faith belief that disclosure is
        necessary to protect its rights, to ensure the safety of you or others,
        to investigate fraud, or to comply with a government request.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the Service Provider collaborates with trusted service providers
        acting on its behalf, who agree not to use the disclosed information
        independently and to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>【Opt-Out Rights】</h2>
    <p>
      By uninstalling the App, you can stop all information collection by the
      App. You may uninstall it using your mobile device’s standard removal
      procedure or via your application marketplace or network.
    </p>

    <h2>【Data Retention Policy】</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider will retain user-provided data for as long as you use
      the App and for a reasonable period thereafter. If you wish to request
      deletion of any user data you have provided through the App, please
      contact us at
      <a href="mailto:tanochan34@gmail.com">tanochan34@gmail.com</a>, and we
      will respond within a reasonable timeframe.
    </p>

    <h2>【Children’s Privacy】</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider does not knowingly collect data from children under
      the age of 13 or engage in marketing to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
      information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children
      not to submit personally identifiable information through the App or
      Service. The Service Provider recommends that parents or legal guardians
      monitor their children’s internet use and instruct them not to provide
      personally identifiable information through the App or Service without
      permission.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it is believed that a child has provided personally identifiable
      information to the Service Provider via the App or Service, please contact
      the Service Provider at
      <a href="mailto:tanochan34@gmail.com">[tanochan34@gmail.com]</a>
      and we will take the necessary action. You must also be at least 16 years
      old to consent to the processing of personally identifiable information
      (in some countries, a parent or legal guardian may provide consent on your
      behalf).
    </p>

    <h2>【Security】</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider strives to maintain the confidentiality of your
      information. To protect the information it processes and retains, the
      Service Provider implements physical, electronic, and procedural security
      measures.
    </p>

    <h2>【Changes】</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The
      Service Provider will notify you of changes by posting the updated Privacy
      Policy on this page and displaying an in-app pop-up about the policy
      update. We recommend that you review this Privacy Policy periodically.
      Continued use of the App constitutes your acceptance of all changes.
    </p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of December 1, 2024.</p>

    <h2>【User Consent】</h2>
    <p>
      By using the App, you agree to the processing of information as described
      in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>【Contact】</h2>

      If you have any questions about privacy during your use of the App or
      about how your information is handled, please contact the Service Provider
