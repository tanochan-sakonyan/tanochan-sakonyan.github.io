    <h1>Terms Of Service</h1>

    <h2>Terms Of Service</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Use apply to the Shukinkun app (hereinafter the “App”), a
      mobile-device application provided free of charge by Yuma Ikeo
      (hereinafter the “Service Provider”). Future updates may introduce certain
      paid features.
    </p>

    <p>
      By downloading or using the Shukinkun app, you automatically agree to the
      following terms. You are strongly advised to read and fully understand
      these terms before using the app. Unauthorized copying, modification, or
      use of any part of the app or its trademarks is strictly prohibited. You
      may not extract the app’s source code, translate it into other languages,
      or create any derivative works. All trademarks, copyrights, database
      rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the app are the
      exclusive property of the Service Provider.
    </p>

    <h2>【Service Provider’s Responsibilities】</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider devotes its utmost efforts to ensuring the App’s
      usefulness and efficiency. Accordingly, the Service Provider reserves the
      right, at any time and for any reason, to modify the App or convert the
      Service to a paid model. The Service Provider guarantees that any fees
      associated with the App or Service will be communicated clearly in
      advance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The App will store and process the personal information you provide in
      order to deliver the Service. You are responsible for maintaining access
      to the App and the security of your device. The Service Provider warns
      against jailbreaking or rooting your device. Such actions remove the
      restrictions imposed by the device’s official operating system,
      potentially exposing your device to malware or viruses, compromising
      security features, and causing the App to malfunction.
    </p>

    <h2>【Limitation of Liability】</h2>
    <p>
      Some features of the App require an Internet connection, either via Wi-Fi
      or your mobile network provider. The Service Provider is not liable if the
      App does not function fully when you cannot access Wi-Fi or have exhausted
      your data allowance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please understand that if you use the App outside of a Wi-Fi area, your
      mobile network provider’s terms and conditions will apply. As a result,
      data usage charges or other third-party fees may be incurred while
      connecting to the App. By using the App, you acknowledge and accept
      responsibility for these charges—including roaming data fees when using
      the App abroad (i.e., outside your home region or country)—unless you have
      disabled data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on
      which you use the App, you confirm that you have obtained permission from
      the bill payer. Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always be held
      responsible for your use of the App. For example, the Service Provider
      will not be liable if your device’s battery is depleted and you lose
      access to the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>【Updates and Service Termination】</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider may release updates to the Shukinkun app. The app is
      currently provided in accordance with the requirements of supported
      operating systems (and the Service Provider may add support for other
      systems at its discretion). Accordingly, to continue using the Shukinkun
      app, you must install updates when prompted. The Service Provider does not
      warrant that the app will always remain relevant to you or compatible with
      a particular version of your device’s operating system. However, you agree
      to accept any updated version of the Shukinkun app upon release. The
      Service Provider may also decide to terminate the Shukinkun app service
      and discontinue its availability without prior notice. Upon such
      termination, unless otherwise notified by the Service Provider, you agree
      that: (1)All rights and licenses granted to you under these Terms will
      immediately expire, and (2)You must cease all use of the Shukinkun app
      and, if necessary, remove it from your device.
    </p>

    <h2>【Changes to Terms of Use】</h2>
    <p>
      The Service Provider may periodically update these Terms of Use.
      Accordingly, you are encouraged to review this page regularly so you can
      be aware of any changes. When the Terms are revised, the Service Provider
      will post the updated Terms here and notify you via an in-app pop-up. Your
      continued use of the Shukinkun app after such updates constitutes your
      acceptance of the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <p>These Terms of Use are effective as of December 1, 2024.</p>
